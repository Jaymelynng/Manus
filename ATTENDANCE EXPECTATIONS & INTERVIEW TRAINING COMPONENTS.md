### **ATTENDANCE EXPECTATIONS TRAINING MODULE**
*To be included in Shadow #1 phase*

**Training Component:** Review and discuss attendance expectations document

**Key Learning Objectives:**

### **INTERVIEW SKILLS & VOCABULARY TRAINING**
*Perfect for building confidence and defining callouts*

#### **MOCK INTERVIEW SCENARIOS**
**Purpose:** Help coaches understand terminology while building professional communication skills

**Setup:** Trainee plays coach, trainer plays concerned parent

**Sample Questions Trainees Must Answer:**
- "What does 'cast handstand' mean and why is it important?"
- "My child seems scared of the beam - how do you handle fear?"
- "What's the difference between a cartwheel and a round-off?"

**Learning Outcome:** Forces trainees to:

- Demonstrate knowledge of safety protocols
- Practice professional communication

**Scenario 2: Manager Interview Practice**
**Setup:** Trainee interviewed for coaching position

**Sample Questions:**
- "Describe your approach to spotting a back walkover"
- "How would you handle a student who refuses to try a skill?"
- "What would you do if you noticed unsafe behavior in another coach?"
- "Explain the progression from bridge to back walkover"
- "How do you maintain class energy and engagement?"

**Assessment Criteria:**
- **Vocabulary Accuracy:** Can they define terms correctly?
- **Safety Knowledge:** Do they prioritize safety in answers?
- **Communication Skills:** Can they explain complex concepts simply?

**Challenge 2: "Safety Callout Quick Response"**
**Scenarios:** Trainer calls out situations, trainee must respond with appropriate callout

**Examples:**

- "Student landing with straight legs" → "Bend your knees like springs!"
- "Student looking down on beam" → "Eyes on the end of the beam!"
- "Student rushing through skill" → "Slow and controlled - show me your best one!"

**Challenge 3: "Positive Correction Translation"**
**Exercise:** Convert negative corrections to positive callouts

**Examples:**
- "Don't bend your arms" → "Show me strong, straight arms!"
- "Stop looking down" → "Eyes forward like a superhero!"
- "You're going too fast" → "Let's try that with control and power!"
- "That's wrong" → "Let's adjust that to make it even better!"
