# Collaborative Training Tracker Feedback - Ideas to Add

## Email Response to Tanise (Collaborative Tone)

**Subject:** Re: Training Tracker - Love the structure! Some fun ideas to add

Hi Tanise!

This looks really well organized - great systematic approach! I love how you've broken it down by program and created clear progression phases.

To answer Katie's question - yes, completing all the phases before independent classes makes total sense for safety and competency.

I was thinking about some fun ideas that could be added to the stages to make the training even more hands-on and engaging. Just brainstorming here!

## **IDEAS FOR SHADOW PHASES:**

**Parent Perspective Challenge:**
- Have trainees sit in the lobby and watch a class as if they're a parent
- What do they see? What questions would they have? What looks confusing or concerning?
- This could help them understand the parent experience and communicate better

**Vocabulary Building Games:**
- Equipment scavenger hunt - find and name 20 pieces of equipment
- Gymnastics term matching games 
- "Explain it to a 5-year-old" challenge for technical terms

## **IDEAS FOR ASSIST/LEAD PHASES:**

**Video Playback Training:**
- Record trainees spotting and leading class
- Watch it back together - what do they notice?
- Try watching with sound only - how does their voice sound?
- Watch without sound - what does their body language show?
- Watch with both - how do voice and movement work together?

**Quantitative Challenges:**
- "Spot 15 different skills successfully"
- "Give 20 positive corrections in one class"
- "Identify when 5 students are ready for the next skill"
- "Handle 3 different parent questions confidently"

**Real-World Scenarios:**
- What if equipment breaks mid-class?
- How do you handle a scared student?
- Parent asks why their child isn't advancing faster?
- Student gets frustrated and wants to quit?

## **MISSING PIECES THAT MIGHT BE HELPFUL:**

**Success Criteria Ideas:**
- What does "passed evaluation" actually look like?
- Maybe specific benchmarks like "can spot independently with 100% safety" or "maintains positive class energy throughout"

**Timing Guidelines:**
- How long should each phase typically take?
- When do you know someone's ready to move from Shadow #1 to Shadow #2?

**If Someone Struggles:**
- What's the plan if someone doesn't pass evaluation?
- Extra practice? Different approach? Additional mentoring?

## **INTERACTIVE ELEMENTS TO CONSIDER:**

**Student Reading Practice:**
- Can they predict when a student is getting frustrated?
- Do they notice when someone's ready for a challenge?
- Can they spot fear vs. excitement?

**Energy Management:**
- Practice adjusting class energy up or down
- Learn to read when kids need to move vs. focus
- Develop their "coaching voice" for different situations

**Multi-tasking Mastery:**
- Can they spot safely while giving instructions?
- Handle a parent question while maintaining class flow?
- Manage timing while ensuring everyone gets attention?

## **JUST SOME THOUGHTS:**

These are just ideas that could make the training more interactive and help new coaches really understand what they're doing, not just go through the motions. The foundation you've created is solid - these would just add some depth and make it more engaging!

What do you think? Any of these resonate with what you're trying to achieve?
